# HTML & CSS
## DOM
Basically the DOM is just a way to organize tags so that some are inside others.

## List
HTML has two types of list, ordered list (<ol></ol>) and unordered list (<ul></ul>). 
To use the ordered or unordered list you can set the items of the list with the tag <li></li>

## Media 
### Images
The tag to use images inside the html file is: <img></img> but has a couple of attributes that are mandatory. Below is an example of a full line of a image with the attributes necesaries to be correct and work it
  ```<img src="cat.jpg" alt="Cat">```
The images tag does not have ending tag. Besides the attributes mentionated above, the image tag has some others like:
- Width: to adjust the width with pixel
- height: to adjust the height with pixel
In adittion, the src of the image could be an url where the image is.

### Link
```<a href> ```
